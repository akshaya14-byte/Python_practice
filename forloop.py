# get user input for time in seconds and convert to integer
# loop from my_time down to 1, decrementing by 1 each time
#   calculate seconds as remainder of i divided by 60
#   calculate minutes as integer division of i by 60, then remainder divided by 60
#   calculate hours as integer division of i by 3600
#   print the time in HH:MM:SS format with leading zeros
#   pause execution for 1 second
# after loop ends, print "Time's up!"

# get user input for a number and convert to integer
# loop from the entered number up to 100 (inclusive)
#   if the current number is even
#       print the number
#   else
#       continue to next iteration

# get user input for a number and convert to integer
# initialize sum to 0
# loop through each digit in the string representation of the number
#   add the integer value of the digit to sum
# print the sum of the digits

# loop through each character in the string
#   if the character is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u, case insensitive)
#       increment sumvow by 1
